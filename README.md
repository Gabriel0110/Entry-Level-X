# Entry-Level-X
A Django web development project to aggregate entry-level jobs making it easier for people to find them with a one-stop shop rather than digging around on LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. seeing jobs that aren't entry-level but are still incorrectly listed as such.  This is a personal hassle for myself and others, and it's a solvable problem if companies put in the effort.

The idea for this project was from my friend Christian Iannone and myself as we both struggle with finding legitimately entry-level jobs in tech.  I'm currently learning Django on my own, and I thought this was a great project to learn via hands-on experience.
