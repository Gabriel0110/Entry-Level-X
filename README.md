# Entry-Level-X
A Django web development project to aggregate entry-level jobs making it easier for people to find them with a one-stop shop rather than digging around on LinkedIn, Indeed, etc. seeing jobs that aren't entry-level but are still incorrectly listed as such.  This is a personal hassle for myself and others, and it's a solvable problem.
